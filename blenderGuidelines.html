          Ever had a problem with blender? #meToo
          <br>
          So, here's a list of problems things that helped me working with blender,
          all this for the fresh version 2.8!

        <h2>Weird behaviour with paste flipped keyframes</h2>
        <p>
          When I wanted to flip the animations for my run-cycle they were flipped totally wrong and not on x-axis.
          This solved my issue:
          <br>
          <b>BTW!:</b> Always make things in blender with teh front facing the Y-axis, left and right the X-axis and Z to the top!
        </p>
        <p>On <a href="https://blenderartists.org">blenderartists</a> I found this solution by user Sago:</p>
        <q cite="https://blenderartists.org/t/paste-x-flipped-pose-in-walkcycle-not-working/492572/11">
          <li>delete all keyframes of the animation, and select all bones in Pose Mode and clear rotation (Alt+R) and position (Alt+G)</li>
          <li>in Object mode, go to Top view (Numpad 7) and Alt+R the Armature, then rotate it 90 degrees on Z-axis (it should face front view now)</li>
          <li>to apply rotation, press <span class="dashed">Ctrl+N</span> <span class="corrected">Ctrl+A</span> and choose Rotation</li>
        </q>

        <p>
          It worked fine for me, even though I had to re-do all my animations. Always check your models, riggs and armature for correct positions and rotations!
          And I didn't even had to re-rotate by 90 degrees.
