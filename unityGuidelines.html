        <h2>Unity Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          When I started to work with Unity I needed a lot of tutorials, time and help
          to reach my first goals. It's not different today, the only things changed are
          the things I search for.
          <br>I want to provide some things I learned about Unity on this webpage
          to help people who struggle with similar or even the same issues as me.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also important to take note that all these things here are just some advices,
          I'm not a professional Unity developer.
          <br>I don't know when to call someone a professional, at least I'm not one.
          It all comes down to experience and knowledge, so today,
          in a time where almost everything can be found on the web,
          everyone could become a professional Unity developer.
          It is my claim to keep the quality of my work as high as possible.
          And with that in mind I do the best I can to achieve what I want.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's begin and take a look around for things you want to know or that might be usefull for you.

        <h2>Update, FixedUpdate or even LateUpdate?</h2>
        <p>
          This question can be really tough... I "struggled" with this for a while,
          but with a little bit of research I found reliable resources within Unity's
          Manual/Scripting API and forum posts. At first, let's have a look at the official
          Documentation:
        </p>
        <q cite="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html#UpdateOrder">
          Update Order
          <br>When you’re keeping track of game logic and interactions, animations,
          camera positions, etc., there are a few different events you can use.
          The common pattern is to perform <b>most tasks inside the Update function</b>,
          but there are also other functions you can use.
          <br>
          <br>FixedUpdate: FixedUpdate is often <b>called more frequently than Update</b>.
          It can be called multiple times per frame, if the frame rate is low
          and it may not be called between frames at all if the frame rate is high.
          All physics calculations and updates occur immediately after FixedUpdate.
          When applying movement calculations inside FixedUpdate, you do not need
          to multiply your values by Time.deltaTime. This is because FixedUpdate
          is called on a reliable timer, <b>independent of the frame rate</b>.
          <br>
          <br>Update: Update is <b>called once per frame</b>.
          It is the main workhorse function for frame updates.
          <br>
          <br>LateUpdate: LateUpdate is <b>called once per frame, after Update has finished</b>.
          Any calculations that are performed in Update will have completed when LateUpdate begins.
          A common use for LateUpdate would be a following third-person camera.
          If you make your character move and turn inside Update,
          <b>you can perform all camera movement and rotation calculations in LateUpdate</b>.
          This will ensure that the character has moved completely before the camera
          tracks its position.
        </q>
        <p>
          At first glance this can be very helpfull, although some tutorials may differ
          their code from this recommendations. This is of course a critical point where
          you should ask "is that -okay-?" - sure it is! Most of the time... I think so?
          <br> Well, at least I found one good source that helped me deciding between using
          Update and FiedUpdate:
        </p>
        <q cite="https://forum.unity.com/threads/solved-unity-move-with-fixedupdate-more-efficient.386937/">
          FixedUpdate runs at fixed time intervals, referred to as fixed-time-step
          found in edit>project settings>time. This is useful for physics since physics
          updates using the same fixed-time-step as well. Update runs every frame.
          This is useful for player input for its immediacy. Not sure how to give a
          concise list on when to use what since it depends on the situation,
          but in general you weigh between immediacy and consistency.

        <h2>Programming Pattern for C#</h2>

        <article>

          <h3>The object pool design pattern</h3>
          <p>
            The object pool is used to provide a pool of objects that are often created and destroyed.
            The pool itself is a generic class to create object instances, store unused instances and release them to be used again.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several ways to extend the class/concept, but I gonna leave it here the way I use it for my game project.
            <br>Pay attention to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/where-generic-type-constraint">"where T : new()"</a>
            and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentbag-1.trytake?view=netframework-4.8">"TryTake(out item)"</a> parts,
            if they look unfamiliar to you (Well, at least it looked unfamiliar to me...).
            They are easily to understand, but check 'em out, I linked the pages (you may change the language from German to English with the slider in the top right corner).
            You should also have a quick look at the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentbag-1?view=netframework-4.8">ConcurrentBag</a>,
            so you really don't miss a thing with that.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
using System.Collections.Concurrent;

public class ObjectPool<T> where T : new()
{
    private readonly ConcurrentBag<T> items = new ConcurrentBag<T>();
    private int counter = 0;

    public void Release(T item)
    {
        items.Add(item);
        counter++;
    }

    // Returns an existing T object from pool or creates a new one
    public T Get()
    {
        T item;
        if (items.TryTake(out item))
        {
            counter--;
            return item;
        }
        else
        {
            T obj = new T();
            items.Add(obj);
            counter++;
            return obj;
        }
    }
}</code>

        <h2>OnGUI vs Canvas (and other UI components)</h2>
        <p>
          I will just make this one short:
          <br>
          Whenever you want to use on screen stuff for <b>serious implementation</b>, and not just as some kind of debugging, <b>always use the canvas</b>!
          The <b>OnGUI function</b> is deprecated and stays in Unity for developers to <b>quickly display information ingame/at runtime</b>.
        </p>
        <!-- Insert picture of my field with OnGUI text -->
        <p>
          Here's the <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1116271/efficiency-more-ongui-versus-recttransforms-on-a-c.html">source</a>.

        <h2>Saving and Loading Data (Serialization)</h2>

        <p>
          Having persistent data outside of the editor is a thing of special importance.
          One who has the need of it may run in some troubble. A mistake I made was to think that you can easily serialize everything as a
          <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html">ScriptableObjects</a> in Unity.
          Instead you needed to code some <b>serialization function</b> for your data type(s).
          <a href="https://youtu.be/J6FfcJpbPXE">Unity Live Training</a> (YouTube, start watching at
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6FfcJpbPXE&feature=youtu.be&t=1955">32:35</a>, if you just want to see code)
          <br>
          This is done with the System-library, so all Unity datatypes, such as Vector3, won't be able to be serialize, <b>*UNLESS*</b> you add a custom so called
          <a href="https://riptutorial.com/csharp/example/14386/serialization-surrogates--implementing-iserializationsurrogate-">Serialization Surrogate</a>.
          An <b>example of a surrogate for Vector3</b> can be found <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/vector3-is-not-marked-serializable.435303/">in this blogpost's answer</a>
