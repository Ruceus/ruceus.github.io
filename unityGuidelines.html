          <h2>Update, FixedUpdate or even LateUpdate?</h2>
          <p>
            This question can be really tough... I "struggled" with this for a while,
            but with a little bit of research I found reliable resources within Unity's
            Manual/Scripting API and forum posts. At first, let's have a look at the official
            Documentation:
          </p>
          <q cite="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html#UpdateOrder">
            Update Order
            <br>When you’re keeping track of game logic and interactions, animations,
            camera positions, etc., there are a few different events you can use.
            The common pattern is to perform <b>most tasks inside the Update function</b>,
            but there are also other functions you can use.
            <br>
            <br>FixedUpdate: FixedUpdate is often <b>called more frequently than Update</b>.
            It can be called multiple times per frame, if the frame rate is low
            and it may not be called between frames at all if the frame rate is high.
            All physics calculations and updates occur immediately after FixedUpdate.
            When applying movement calculations inside FixedUpdate, you do not need
            to multiply your values by Time.deltaTime. This is because FixedUpdate
            is called on a reliable timer, <b>independent of the frame rate</b>.
            <br>
            <br>Update: Update is <b>called once per frame</b>.
            It is the main workhorse function for frame updates.
            <br>
            <br>LateUpdate: LateUpdate is <b>called once per frame, after Update has finished</b>.
            Any calculations that are performed in Update will have completed when LateUpdate begins.
            A common use for LateUpdate would be a following third-person camera.
            If you make your character move and turn inside Update,
            <b>you can perform all camera movement and rotation calculations in LateUpdate</b>.
            This will ensure that the character has moved completely before the camera
            tracks its position.

            At first glance this can be very helpfull, although some tutorials may differ
            their code from this recommendations. This is of course a critical point where
            you should ask "is that -okay-?" - sure it is! Most of the time... I think so?
            <br> Well, at least I found one good source that helped me deciding between using
            Update and FiedUpdate:
          </p>
          <q cite="https://forum.unity.com/threads/solved-unity-move-with-fixedupdate-more-efficient.386937/">
            FixedUpdate runs at fixed time intervals, referred to as fixed-time-step
            found in edit>project settings>time. This is useful for physics since physics
            updates using the same fixed-time-step as well. Update runs every frame.
            This is useful for player input for its immediacy. Not sure how to give a
            concise list on when to use what since it depends on the situation,
            but in general you weigh between immediacy and consistency.
